# Pieter's Solutions for CS50 Courses' Assignments

#### Hello!
This repository contains two folders housing all my solutions for the assignments from the first Harvard's CS50 course I've taken so far;
```
CS50X: Introduction to The Art of Computer Science and programming,
```
Feel free take a look and please do excuse my earlier solutions which is quite rough & messy since I practically have no coding experience prior to taking this course.

Below I've listed the name assignments of CS50X for context as well as links to the specifications of each assignments:
